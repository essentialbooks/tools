To get the first version:

* fix:

fe/main.js â†’ www/gen/bundle.js...
(!) Circular dependency
fe\Toc.svelte -> fe\TocItem.svelte -> fe\Toc.svelte

I think I fixed it in some other code base. Use <svelte:self> ?

* make 404.html design match the rest of the book better
* add ability to have one gist serve as multiple examples
  idea: accept url like:
  https://codeeval.dev/gist/2f493d47f6d8bb328a3a86e4bbefff9c/main.go
  where main.go is the file to execute
  Gist could have multiple files. They would have to have ":run" directive

* [ ] make sitemap for all books
