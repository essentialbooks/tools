* add redirects from www.programming-books.io
* verify google analyticss
* write sitemap.txt
* create book-index for www.programming-books.io
* re-add comment submission.
* then the top would show name of the book, point to the top of book and
  we won't need one level of breadcrumbs at the top of page
* add -preview option that runs `vercel dev` at the end for a given book
* add a way to generate html page with structure of the page, for easy finding
  pages to edit. Shows which pages have snippets, images, codeeval.com links etc.
* make 404.html design match the rest of the book better
* add ability to have one gist serve as multiple examples
  idea: accept url like:
  https://codeeval.dev/gist/2f493d47f6d8bb328a3a86e4bbefff9c/main.go
  where main.go is the file to execute
  Gist could have multiple files. They would have to have ":run" directive

Command to create a project or link to existing project:
vercel www --scope teamkjk --name book-git --confirm

Command to preview locally:
cd www
vercel dev
